# scheduler_django Proficiency_test Option D
App timeline:
- 5 days, date started: Sun, 22/8/21, date ended: Thu, 26/8/21

Purpose of app:
 - Allow users to login and logout
 - Allow users to input their available dates and shifts
 - Allow users to rank their shifts accordingly
 - Generates schedules for any selected date based on the availabilities and shift rankings of users
 
 Features I wish to improve on or add in the future:
 - Enable hosting on a web server, e.g. Heroku
 - Front-end design, as of now the display of schedules looks a little bad
    > Enable pagination if schedule list exceeds certain amount of rows in a page
